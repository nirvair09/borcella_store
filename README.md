This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

I was using a US test card for transactions in INR, which led to the error mentioned in the question. The correct approach is to use an Indian test card specifically designed for transactions in INR.

For testing purposes in INR, it's recommended to use the following Indian Test Visa Card:

Indian Test Visa Card: 4000 0035 6000 0008
